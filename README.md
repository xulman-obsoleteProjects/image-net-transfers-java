Here's the Java implementation of a proprietary image transfer protocol.

It considers [imglib2](http://imglib2.net/) image representation, and transfers
it over a network via ZeroMQ. The protocol documentation, including a bit of
rationale/motivation and example code, can be found as PDFs in the `doc` folder.

The repository contains also wrapping Fiji plugins.
